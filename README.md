Capstone Project for KnowledgeHut

This is a MERN stack app created in an attempt to complete the knowledgehut capstone project.

There is only a barebones functionality at the moment. The application works by first directing to login/signup pages. Once the user logs in, a token is created for authentication allowing for the individual user access.
This was originally designed to be a workout application that helps track workout information. The current functionality allows adding new exercises, picking a list of exercises to be included in a workout, and starting a workout
which recreates the exercise list with checkboxes. 

The frontend was done using react, the backend was done using nodejs and express, and the database was done using mongodo atlas. 

In order to test the functionality of this app, clone the repository. node.js, react, react-router-dom, cors, and express should be installed.
Open a terminal, navigate to the app folder and start using "npm start"
Open a separate terminal, navigate to the server folder, and start the server using "node server.mjs"

The website runs on "http://localhost:3300
