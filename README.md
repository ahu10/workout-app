Capstone Project for KnowledgeHut

This is a MERN stack app created in an attempt to complete the knowledgehut capstone project.

There is only a barebones functionality at the moment. The application works by first directing to login/signup pages. Once the user logs in, a token is created for authentication allowing for the individual user access.
This was originally designed to be a workout application that helps track workout information. The current functionality allows adding new exercises, picking a list of exercises to be included in a workout, and starting a workout
which recreates the exercise list with checkboxes. 

The frontend was done using react, the backend was done using nodejs and express, and the database was done using mongodo atlas.
